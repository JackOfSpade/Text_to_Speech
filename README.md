This interface bridges the gap between common users and the Amazon Polly API (featuring the most natural sounding voices available).

Amazon Polly currently does not provide a user-friendly software for its API.

# To Use
Download and run `TextToSpeech.jar`

# For Developers:
Due to security reasons, the API key for Amazon Web Services (AWS) is not included in the source code. You must create a `config.ini` file at the root level in the following format:

```ini
[accuweather_api_keys]
key=your_key_here
```

You can get a free AWS API Key here: https://aws.amazon.com/console/
